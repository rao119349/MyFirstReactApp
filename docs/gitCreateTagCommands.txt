Creating Tags

Git uses two main types of tags: lightweight and annotated.

Annotated Tags:

To create an annotated tag in Git you can just run the following simple commands on your terminal.

$ git tag -a v2.1.0 -m "xyz feature is released in this tag."
$ git tag
v1.0.0
v2.0.0
v2.1.0
The -m denotes message for that particular tag. We can write summary of features which is going to tag here.

Lightweight Tags:

The other way to tag commits is lightweight tag. We can do it in the following way:

$ git tag v2.1.0
$ git tag
v1.0.0
v2.0.0
v2.1.0
Push Tag

To push particular tag you can use below command:

git push origin v1.0.3
Or if you want to push all tags then use the below command:

git push --tags
List all tags:

To list all tags, use the following command.

git tag
